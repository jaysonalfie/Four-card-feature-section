## My process
I was able to use React together with Vite to create the webpage and it was also an opportunity to look into CSS grid and how it works so as to properly style the cards. I also used flex in the arrangement of components in the webpage. I used Vanilla CSS for styling. I was also able to use the mobile first approach through the media queries to attain responsivity.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Css custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
